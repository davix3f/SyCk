# SyCk is a syntax checker for programming languages.

The aim is to provide devs a fast, easy-to-use tool to check the correct syntax of those languages that requires compilation; it's _really_ annoying to discover a forgotten parenthesis, or semicolon, or other basic errors at the end, sometimes, of a long compilation.

For this reason, I decided to wrote this tool that will check our source code with a quite fast language, Python.
The nature of Python will make this program really hackable and customizable for any personal need, without altering performances and anything.

## Why should I use this tool?
The key of this tool will be its flexibility: in fact, the main checker tool (SyCk.py in _/master/src_) will
use the syntax models and patterns of the py files in _/master/Languages_; so, you could invent your own programming language, write a syntax-guide file, eventually correct some lines in SyCk and it's done!

### How can I help?
My aim is to give this program a GUI (prob in GTK3+, since I develop on Debian and it's a quite easy-to-implement GUI system), and lately to write it in CYthon for even better performances. One day.
Also, I don't know _all_ the languages in the world (e.g. Java, C#, Swift..), so I count on **your** help to write those syntax files, even more than the SyCk src code.
